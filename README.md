An online synth for playing MIDI keyboard using Web MIDI API.

Try out: http://miroshko.github.io/midi

The motivation was to create a small, free and easy program for playing MIDI
keyboards connected to iPhone/iPad. For IOS there's a custom browser which supports
Web MIDI API: http://www.taktech.org/takm/WebMIDIBrowser/Web_MIDI_Browser.html
so the page should be open with it. On other platforms the synth can be used as
long as the browser supports the MIDI API.

At the moment it's just the basic sine wave, the plan is first of all to add
more sounds and then the ability to record the music played.
