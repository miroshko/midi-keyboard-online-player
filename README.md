An online synth for playing MIDI keyboard using Web MIDI API

The motivation was to create a small, free and easy program for playing with MIDI
keyboards connected to iPhone/iPad. For IOS there's a custom browser which supports
Web MIDI API: http://www.taktech.org/takm/WebMIDIBrowser/Web_MIDI_Browser.html
so the page should be open with it. On other platforms the synth can be used as
long as the browser supports the MIDI API.
